## 2. Overview of Architectures

Per the Deliverable 2 brief, our group produced the required minimum of 4 prototypes:

| Architecture | Description | Prototype Type |
|---|---|---|
| (a) | ESP32 + MQ-5 + DHT22 + LCD | **Physical** and **Simulated** (both required) |
| (b) | ESP32 (MQ-5) ↔ ESP32 (DHT22), interfaced directly | **Physical** |
| (c) | ESP32 (DHT22) → Relay → ESP32 (MQ-5) | **Simulated** |

(b) and (c) are interchangeable per the brief; our group built (b) physically and (c) as a simulation.

## 6. Issues Encountered and Resolutions

- **Problem:** The LCD module for architecture (a) did not display any output during physical testing.
- **Solutions explored:** Wiring connections were checked and re-checked. Two likely causes were identified:
Insufficient voltage being delivered to the LCD, or
Complete failure of the LCD module itself
Given the time available before submission, we were unable to conclusively isolate and fix the root cause.
- **Recommendation / resolution:** Despite the LCD issue, the IDE serial monitor produced correct, meaningful output — confirming that the underlying program logic (sensor reads, data formatting, thresholds) was working as intended. This strongly suggests the fault is isolated to the hardware/display layer rather than the code.
